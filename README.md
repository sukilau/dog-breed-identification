# Dog Breed Image Recognition
 
## Task

* Problem : Developing an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app to accept any user-supplied image as input. If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed. If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.
* Construct CNN from scratch, use transfer learning (VGG-16 and Xception) and OpenCV (human face detector) to build dog breed identification app.
* Accuracy score of 84.33% by obatined by the final model.

* For dog breed idetification, first construct a CNN from scratch and train the CNN using image data scrapped from the web, and then use transfer learning and tested with VGG-16 nad Xception.
* For human face detection, use OpenCV.
* Combine the above identification functionality and build a dog breed idetification app.
